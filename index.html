<h1>HERMETICO TYPEFACE</h1>

<p>"Hermetico" is a tribute to Hermes 3000 typewriter font &quot;Techno&quot;. It comes in two styles: Regular and <em>Emphasised</em>. You can download the files <a href="https://github.com/HTP3000/htp3000.github.io/tree/master/css/hermetico">here</a></p>

<h2>The project</h2>

<p>Not long ago I fell in love with the design of Hermes 3000 typewriter Techno font (there are three slightly different styles under this name: Tecnho “Pica” [10pt], Techno “Special” [10pt] and Techno “Elite” [12pt]).</p>

<p>I looked for some digital revivals of this wonderful typeface, but I could not find one that really satisfied me. There are indeed some digital interpretation of Hermes 3000 Techno font, but to my eyes there was always something missing.</p>

<p>I think that closest digital font to the Techno typeface is “Magda”, by Cornel Windlin. It is a really beautiful typeface, but I feel like it is a little too fuzzy. And, of course, it does not come for free.</p>

<p>So, since I was unhappy with the existing solutions, I tried to create my own version of this typeface, even if I was totally unexperienced as a type designer.</p>

<h2>My interpretation</h2>

<p>My original idea was to create a font that had exactly the same character set of a Hermes 3000 equipped with the “Techno” font. But as soon as I started working on the project, I understood that there was not just <em>one</em> character set: character sets changed depending on the year in which the typewriters were produced and on the target market.</p>

<p>Since I worked on specimens coming from two different typewriters – respectively produced in 1968 and 1970, and each with some peculiarities in the character sets – I thought that there was no point in sticking to the set of just one model. I wanted to include in my font as many glyphs as possible.</p>

<p>The more I worked on the font, the more I convinced myself that I had to include some characters that were not in the “original” sets. However, in adding the “new” glyphs, I tried to be as faithful to my sources as possible, using only shapes that were <em>already</em> in the character set and transforming them (kind of “philological” approach, isn’t it?).</p>

<p>As an example, I added “guillemets” angle quotes, which were missing on the typewriters: but I designed the glyphs starting from the shape of the “v” letter. If you are interested in knowing which were the original character sets of Hermes typewriters, you can do some research on the Internet: you will find plenty of documentation. <a href="https://github.com/HTP3000/htp3000.github.io/raw/master/hermetico/Hermetico.pdf">Here</a> you can find a complete list of the glyps included in "Hermetico".</p>

<p>Some of the modern digital typefaces inspired by typewriters fonts have a huge drawback: they lack of way to emphasise the text, since the italic style is missing in the original source.
But we all know that, when using a typewriter, one can emphasise the text by underlining it. </p>

<p>With that in mind, I have created an “Italic” style for “Hermetico”, which is nothing more than the Regular style, but underlined. If you install both the styles on your computer, you will be able to emphasise your text, if needed. For obvious reasons, there is no a “Bold” style for the font.</p>

<p>As I said, I am not a professional type designer, but I do love fonts and I wanted to share my work with the typeface-lovers community. </p>

<h2>How I did it</h2>
<p>The whole process was pretty straightforward. I worked on high resolution scans of typewritten specimens. At first I adjusted the scans with open-source graphics editor, cleaning the images as well as I could. Then I traced the images and worked on them with the most common open-souce font editors available... And that's pretty much it!

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>"Hermetico" project is still ongoing. I am currently working on some adjustments and I am considering adding few glyphs, so you can expect some news in the near future. Since the project is still under development there could be bugs that I am not aware of, please keep that in mind when you use the fonts. </p>
	
<h2>License</h2>
<p>"Hermetico" is free under the terms of the SIL Open Fonts License (OFL). That means  you can do what you want to with the fonts as long as you:
1) retain the ofl notice, even if you distribute it in a modified form; 2) don’t sell them on their own; 3) don’t claim they were your work. </p>
